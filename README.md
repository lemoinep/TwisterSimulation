My objective is to explore various concepts in physics by formulating problems mathematically and conducting simulations. 
This approach will yield many interesting and valuable insights.

It is still under construction. Other elements will be integrated soon.

Tornado Simulation 

This project is an interactive 3D Tornado Simulation Built with Python and the Ursina Engine.
It visualizes the physical structure and dynamics of a tornado using a party system and a procedurally generated terrain. 
The Simulation is based on Physical Vortex Models (Rankine Vortex) and include Realistic Features Such as Airflow, Debris, 
and Tornado Movement over a Customizable Landscape.
